 AddStockRelationshipObjectTypeIndex

=head1 SYNOPSIS

mx-run AddStockRelationshipObjectTypeIndex [options] -H hostname -D dbname -u username [-F]

this is a subclass of L<CXGN::Metadata::Dbpatch>
see the perldoc of parent class for more details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This patch adds an index on stock_relationship (object_id, type_id).
Lookups of the parents of an accession join stock_relationship by object_id
and type_id. With only the single-column object_id index, each lookup reads
every link that points to the accession (all its plots, plants and tissue
samples) and discards them.

On a large database the index can be built beforehand without blocking writes:
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY stock_relationship_object_id_type_id_idx
ON public.stock_relationship (object_id, type_id);
This patch then finds the index and does nothing. Check first that the prebuilt
index is valid (pg_index.indisvalid): an interrupted concurrent build leaves an
invalid index with the same name, and IF NOT EXISTS skips that one too.

This subclass uses L<Moose>. The parent class uses L<MooseX::Runnable>
